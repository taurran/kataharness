# STATE — KataHarness

**Phase:** v0.1 skill-complete · Modes Spec A1+A2+A3 merged · **Version:** pre-v0.1 · **Updated:** 2026-06-08

## Where we are
- Project scaffolded at `C:\Dev\Projects\KataHarness` (git, `.gitattributes eol=lf`). Foundation committed.
- Canonical docs: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (pointer), `docs/{DESIGN,STANDARDS,TEST-PLAN}.md`, `README.md`
  (versioned skill index). `.planning/{PROJECT,ROADMAP,DECISIONS(16),LESSONS-LEARNED(10),BACKLOG,STATE,STEERING,REVIEW-v0.1}.md`.
- Reference skills vendored (gitignored): `research/reference/{mattpocock-skills,bmad-method}`; GSD local
  at `~/.claude/get-shit-done`.
- **15 `kata-*` skills built**, all `0.1.0/experimental`: the v0.1 ten + `kata-review` + the four
  v0.2-pulled-forward (`kata-diagnose`, `kata-selfhandoff`, `kata-improve`, `kata-write-skill`). 3 remain
  unbuilt: `kata-tasklist` (deferred — redundant with state.json + the plan DAG until workers self-select),
  `kata-zoom-out` (deferred — too thin), `kata-engram` (backlog, gated on a mature engram, D9). The README
  index is the source of truth. (Adversarial-reviewed → `.planning/REVIEW-v0.1.md`; new batch review pending.)
- **CPP baseline frozen** for the test: tag `cpp-phase2-baseline` pushed (220 tests green).

## Done so far (this session, 2026-06-06)
- Froze the shared control: CPP `03-DESIGN.md` + `03-01-PLAN.md` (4 locked decisions, 4-task disjoint partition).
- Built the **5 v0.1 execution skills** (`kata-orchestrate/worktree/board/tdd/evaluate`) → `0.1.0/experimental`.
- Ran **Arm A** (KataHarness via Sonnet subagents in CPP worktrees) → GREEN: 244 tests, det build, Snyk 0,
  fresh-context `kata-evaluate` 9/9 PASS, **0 drift / 0 escalations / 0 human interventions** ([[LESSONS-LEARNED]] L9).
- Arm A lives on CPP branch `test/phase3-kata` (worktree `C:/Dev/_kata_armA/integration`).

## Also done (2026-06-06, cont.)
- **A/B verdict recorded: TIE** ([[LESSONS-LEARNED]] L10). Arm B (GSD) matched Arm A on every objective
  metric incl. the identical in-lane auto-fix → execution half on-par, not better; differentiation lives in
  the (frozen-for-both) planning half. User shipping Arm B to CPP `main`.
- **Built the remaining v0.1 planning skills + the adversarial leg** → all `0.1.0/experimental`:
  `kata-grill` (deep, to the L8 standard: GSD-format choice-or-text questions, relentless + doc-grounded,
  doc-baking, convergence criteria, anti-shallow guard + a `resources/DECISION-LEDGER.md`),
  `kata-context`, `kata-design-doc`, `kata-plan` (disjoint file-ownership + wave DAG), `kata-handoff`,
  and **`kata-review`** (adversarial/red-team — the EVALUATE leg the A/B exposed as missing, L10).
- **v0.1 is now skill-complete: 11 skills built** (the 10 + kata-review). README index promoted.

## Active workstream — OPERATING MODES (Spec A1 + A2 + A3 MERGED to master; A3 on 2026-06-08)

**Spec A1 (foundations) DONE + merged**: skill-conformance validator (`tools/validate_skills.py`), schema-v2
frontmatter (`cost-weight`+`license`+namespaced `tags`), frontmatter-generated README index,
`protocol/config.md`+`protocol/dependencies.md`, `docs/TAXONOMY.md`, Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`. Reviewed HOLD→SHIP.
**Spec A2 (tier families) DONE**: `kata-grill`/`kata-review`/`kata-plan` → 3 tiers each, `kata-diagnose` →
light/full; shared `RUBRIC.md` per family (DRY-by-pointer); `kata-design-doc`/`kata-tdd` got a mode depth-hint;
validator gained tier-family rules. Adversarially reviewed (HOLD→SHIP; surfaced **D33: structural invariants
are never tiered**).
**Spec A3 (bootstrap + wiring) DONE + merged 2026-06-08** (merge `27ca76c`): **`kata-bootstrap`** (run-shape
router — individual/batch/version-up/advanced as PRESETS over the mode axis; D24c ladder; run-shape-relevant
interview) + new light **`kata-readiness`** (harness-health + target-readiness + re-entrant config detection) +
**`kata-orchestrate`** reads `kata.config`, resolves family→tier (fallback Standard/D25) with a **fail-closed
load-guard** (GB12). `kata.config` schema gained `runShape`+`target` (version-up). Grilled GB1–GB13 → promoted
to **D34–D46**; adversarially reviewed **SHIP** (`.../modes-A3-bootstrap-wiring/REVIEW.md`). **24 skills**,
validator green, 12 tests. Versioning **policy A** (hold all skills at 0.1.0 till v0.1 ships, then bump-on-modify).
**Next: A4** (version-up execution — `kata-graph` ingestion engine + existing-file-aware planning + baseline-green
regression contract; absorbs old Spec C). Then Spec B (bake-off), `design` module. Parallel outstanding: the
D16 planning-varied A/B.


Brainstormed a major new capability: cost/effort/thoroughness **operating modes** (Essential/Standard/Advanced),
all one-shot, consistency-first. Full design in `docs/MODES-DESIGN.md`; vocabulary in `CONTEXT.md`; skill
token-weights in `.planning/SKILL-COST-RATINGS.md`; decisions D17–D23. Prior art researched (FrugalGPT cascade,
Cursor/AgentHub best-of-N, Claude `effort`, GitHub Spec Kit) — pieces exist; our synthesis (skill-set tiering +
escalation-with-reuse + Improvement-Kata version-ups) is the contribution.

## Next action (in order)
1. **Spec A4 — version-up execution** (absorbs old Spec C): grill→plan→build `kata-graph` (pre-processing
   structural map / version-up ingestion engine; agnostic grep/glob/Read core + optional AST/MCP adapter;
   evaluate OSS minimal-step examples per D41) + existing-file-aware planning + the baseline-green regression
   contract (`kata-evaluate` already *is* the no-regression gate). Carry the A3-review A4 notes (BACKLOG):
   sharpen `kata-readiness` Scope 1 harness-vs-target wording. Then Spec B (bake-off), `design` module.
2. **D16 A/B (parallel priority):** planning-VARIED A/B to prove the grill differentiates — still outstanding;
   do before calling v0.1 "validated."
3. **Backlog:** `kata-tasklist` (reframed → virtual board/PM), `kata-zoom-out`, `kata-engram`; adapters; set a
   git remote before public release.

## Model per stage
Build KataHarness → **Opus 4.8**. CPP test arms → **Sonnet 4.6** (constant across arms). I pin subagent
models on spawn; operator sets main-session model via `/model`.

## Concurrent
CPP runs in its own session (Phase 3 next). CPP will consume KataHarness at v0.1; CPP does periodic
status check-ins on this project.

## Open decisions for the user
- License (pre-public). Suite/plugin packaging shape. Whether to do WoZ-first (recommended) or build v0.1
  straight away.
