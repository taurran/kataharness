# KataHarness

**A controllable agent harness that spans the whole spectrum — from spec-driven, interview-shaped sprint
coding to fully automated, self-learning one-shots — all on one vetted, grounded process.**

Most agent tools force a bad choice: babysit every step, or let it loose and watch it spiral. KataHarness
gives you a **dial** instead. Tighten it for **spec-influenced, sprint-by-sprint control**, where an interview
(the "grill") shapes the work to *your* codebase and *your* style and you approve at every boundary. Loosen it
for **hands-off one-shots** that resolve their own ambiguity and learn from every run. In between sits a set of
**well-defined modes** — pick the rigor, the cadence, and how much the harness asks you. Whatever you pick, the
same backbone holds: the **plan doesn't drift**, a fresh-context evaluator that **assumes failure** gates
"done," everything is **grounded and versioned**, and the durable artifacts land in **your own project vault** —
not a black box. The name is the method — the **Improvement Kata**: each loop sharpens the loop.

## What makes KataHarness different

**The throughline is _control_.** Everything below is a way of keeping you in charge while the agents do the work.

- 🎛️ **You set the level of control — per run.** Run it fully human-in-the-loop (spec → grill → approve each
  sprint), fully automated (a hands-off learning one-shot), or anywhere between. Nothing happens off-plan
  without surfacing it to you first.
- 🪜 **Well-defined modes, not vibes.** A consistent system of **effort/rigor tiers** (essential · standard ·
  advanced), **run-shapes** (individual · batch · version-up), and a **delivery axis** (one-shot · incremental
  sprints). Same format across every mode — you compose the run, preview its cost, then launch.
- 🗣️ **An interview that codes like you do.** The **grill** interrogates your idea, learns your codebase's
  conventions and your style, and enriches *your* intent into a frozen spec — with the depth dialed by you
  (`skip → light → standard → full`). Whatever ambiguity you don't resolve up front gets resolved **in-loop by
  a no-write research subagent**, or parked in an assumption log surfaced at the gate — never silently guessed.
- 👥 **Built for every kind of builder.** Spec-driven sprint coder, version-up maintainer, or
  one-shot-it-and-walk-away — same harness, different dials. It meets you where you work.
- ✅ **Backed by sound, vetted process.** Grounding gates, **default-FAIL** evaluation, fresh-context
  adversarial review, and industry-standard practice (TDD, DDD ubiquitous language, vertical-slice planning,
  disjoint file-ownership). "Done" is *earned*, never self-declared — no skill certifies its own work.
- 🧠 **It learns.** Every run mines its own decisions, reviews, and grill ledgers into a **second-brain LEARN
  feed**; agents can distil reusable skills that pass a grounding check **and a human promotion gate** before
  going universal. The harness you run next month is sharper than today's.
- 🗂️ **Lives in your own vault / project.** Durable artifacts are **Obsidian-native** (frontmatter +
  wikilinks + tags) and **git-committed** in *your* workspace — plans, decisions, handoffs, and the learn feed
  are yours to read, not locked in a tool.
- 💾 **Survives every boundary.** Two-way, file-based handoff means work outlives compaction, a dead session,
  or a switch between agents/tools — a fresh agent re-enters mid-stream without re-deriving anything.
- 🔌 **Tool-agnostic.** An agnostic core + thin per-tool adapters (Claude today; Codex/Kiro/ACP next). Your
  discipline travels with you, not with one vendor.

**In short — what people actually want:** an agent you can *trust* and *steer*, that *finishes*, doesn't
spiral, doesn't lose your context, fits *how you build*, and *gets better over time* — on whatever tool you use.

## Status

**`v0.1.0-alpha.1` (first tagged milestone) — skill suite complete & green, not yet field-proven end-to-end.**
35 skills, all `0.1.0`/experimental; validator 0 errors · tests passing · Snyk clean. Two self-dogfood runs
done — the second was a real **orchestrated** version-up (concurrent worker subagents in isolated worktrees,
fresh-context gate, human version-select). The full cognitive architecture is built for the **Claude-only
core**, now spanning **one-shot and incremental (sprint) delivery**, plus the learning loop (LEARN feed +
managed skill promotion). What remains before v0.1 *ships*: the **dogfood** (run the harness against a real
target — its own next version) to turn "built" into "proven"; a small **install & portability layer** (a
one-time init flow + workspace binding so it drops cleanly into *any* vault or project dir, not just the
reference one); then the multi-tool **adapters** (Codex, Kiro, ACP). Live state:
[`.planning/STATE.md`](./.planning/STATE.md) · roadmap: [`.planning/ROADMAP.md`](./.planning/ROADMAP.md).

## The spine (six non-negotiables)

1. **The plan does not drift** — the orchestrator guards it; peers execute + talk, never re-plan.
2. **One-shot = no plan churn** — fix against the same plan; don't re-plan by reflex.
3. **Agnostic via adapters** — agnostic core + thin per-tool adapters.
4. **Default-FAIL** — a fresh-context, no-write evaluator gates "done."
5. **Two-way, file-based handoff** — plus prime-frame self-handoff (survives context rot without bailing early).
6. **Everything versioned** — per-skill semver is the machine source of truth; the catalog is generated.

## The skills

35 skills across the six loop phases (plus the Greater-Loop initiation/closeout modules). Tiered families (`kata-grill`, `kata-plan`, `kata-review`,
`kata-diagnose`) share one `RUBRIC.md` method and expose depth tiers you dial per run.
